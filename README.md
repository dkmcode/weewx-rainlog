A weewx extension to report rain data to http://rainlog.org

From the first Q. in the FAQ: <br>
Rainlog.org is a cooperative rainfall monitoring network for Arizona developed at the UA by SAHRA and Cooperative Extension. SRP has been a leading partner in supporting rainlog.org. Data collected through this network will be used for a variety of applications, from watershed management activities and weather reporting to hydrologic research and drought planning at local, county, and state levels.

A full description of rainlog.org can be found at http://rainlog.org/usprn/html/main/about.jsp and http://rainlog.org/usprn/html/main/faq.jsp

Rainlog's focus is on Arizona but there are people sending data from Washinton state to Tennesse.
